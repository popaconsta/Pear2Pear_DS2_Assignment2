## References
The project is an implementation of **Gossiping with Append-Only Logs in Secure-Scuttlebutt**, by A.M. KERMARREC, E. LAVOIE and C.F. TSCHUDIN.

## Installer
You can download the installer (.jar) from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3RH6i7Yy99SYwwVo4OxiSJc5XMM5kKq/view?usp=sharing) and follow the steps described into  the report.

- Make sure JRE 11 is installed on your system.
- Run the *setup.jar* using the system GUI or by typing *java -jar setup.jar* in the terminal. Follow  the  wizard  steps  in  order  to  accept  the  licence  and  choose  the installation directory.
- Launch  the  simulator  by  executing *start_model.bat*.   A  Java  application  will  be displayed on your screen. If you are using an Apple Mac device then you have to execute *startmodel.command*.
- Set  the  values  of  the  parameters  from  the *Parameter* window.   Once  you  have chosen the parameter values, it is possible to save them for further executions.
- Finally,  you  can  launch  the  simulation  by  clicking  on  the *Initialize Run* button placed on the upper bar.  You can start the simulation by clicking on *Start Run* button or by clicking on the *Step* button.   Simulation execution can be slowed down by increasing the *Schedule Tick Delay* in the *Run Options* window.
